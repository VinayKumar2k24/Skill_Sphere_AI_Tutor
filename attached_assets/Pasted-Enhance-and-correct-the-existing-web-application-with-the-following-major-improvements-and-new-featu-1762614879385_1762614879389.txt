Enhance and correct the existing web application with the following major improvements and new features:

🔒 Security & User Authentication

Implement a secure signup and login system before the user can access the main website.

When a user clicks the “Get Started Free” button, ensure their signup data is properly stored in the database.

Add necessary security protocols to protect user credentials and session data.

👤 User Portal & Navigation Fixes

Fix all existing errors in the user portal.

Ensure that the Profile, Logout, and Settings options open and function correctly.

The user logo (avatar) should be clickable, showing a dropdown with options like Profile, Settings, and Logout.

The Settings button should open a dedicated settings page where users can update their details or preferences.

🌐 Domain Expansion

Add new learning domains to the platform, including:

IoT (Internet of Things)

Space Technology

Hardware Domains

🧩 Quiz and Assessment Flow

After the user completes a quiz, display a detailed result showing which questions were correct and which were wrong.

When the user clicks “Recommend Courses”, it should directly navigate to the Course Recommendation page.

On the Course Recommendation page, after clicking “Enroll”, the selected course should move to the “Enrolled Courses” section instead of displaying all courses again.

Evaluate the user’s performance and declare their level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced).

Suggest next learning steps, topics, or practice exercises accordingly.

Personalize guidance to help users strengthen their weaker areas and improve their skills effectively.

🎨 UI/UX Improvements
